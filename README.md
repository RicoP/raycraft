# Raycraft
A simple minecraft-like game made with [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
There is no physics engine or anything special.
just a map generation and simple blockwork :)

# Build
download a release of raylib (4.0.0) to `./raylib/`.
then run:
```
./build.sh
```
the game will run after the build is completed.

**NOTE:** you can use lower opengl versions or even statically build raylib. it works either way.
